# GitHub as a CMS
This postâ€™s content and metadata are stored in a single Markdown file accessible on a public GitHub repository. When a user loads the `/blog` route or any blog post (`/blog/[id]`), the client sends a request to the GitHub API; Then, using `gray-matter` and `react-markdown`, the content, date, title, and excerpt are parsed, and the content is displayed. However, one disadvantage of using GitHub as a CMS is the rate limiting.
